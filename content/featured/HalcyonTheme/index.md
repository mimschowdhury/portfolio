As part of our Microsoft Industry Project at BrainStation, we pioneered an AI-driven accessibility solution to transform Xbox gaming into an inclusive experience for players of all abilities. 

Our innovative prototype tackles critical barriers faced by individuals with vision, speech, hearing, motor, neurodivergence, and cognitive impairments. By harnessing cutting-edge AI technologies, our solution delivers personalized accessibility features tailored to each playerâ€™s unique needs.
